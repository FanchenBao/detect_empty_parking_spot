# Project Description
This is a term project from CAP6619 Deep Learning, offered in Florida Atlantic University, taught by Dr. Xingquan Zhu (a wonderful teacher by the way). The goal is to create an end-to-end model that can detect empty parking spots in an aero footage.

The footage used is from here:

The detection outcome is presented here:

# Clarification
The basic method used in this project is **NOT mine**. I borrowed it from [this repo](https://github.com/priya-dwivedi/Deep-Learning/tree/master/parking_spots_detector).

Of course, due to the difference in the footage used, some approaches are not the same, but the general idea is the same.

# Documentation
Most of the documentation is available in the notebook. The code is well organized so there is no need repeating them here.

For those interested, a more detailed write up is provided in the `doc/` folder. That write up is also the term project report.
